                            <p>Valor International wants to be the place where you find what you are looking for when you think of volleyball. Encompass the thrill of the sport or embrace the most challenging version of yourself. <a style="color:#FFDF00">Our staff, Coach Rosie Rivera and Coach Isabela da Silva, have been coaching for over 10 years.</a>Sharing the same life goal, to grow every day, and continue learning. We encourage our players to embrace their valor and always be the best version of themselves. We had the chance to play this sport our entire lives. We still do. Volleyball gave us unforgettable memories, forged forever-friends, families, places we could call home, and the primary purpose of life. No matter the hardships of life, we can choose which way we want to go. Volleyball, like any sport, will show that having a purpose in life and trusting your instincts helps you realize your importance in this world. At Valor, every step we take is part of a process. We want everyone to share their goals and purpose so we can have the opportunity to grow together and achieve our success. We want to focus on developing players and ensuring that everyone understands and is capable of all aspects of volleyball. <a style="color:#FFDF00">We have coached many athletes who play at the highest and most competitive divisions in the United States. We have trained professional athletes for their volleyball seasons globally - from the beach to indoor volleyball.</a> Aim and goal are to provide a high degree of technical training for players on three levels: Body, Mind, and Heart.  We train and coach any player that wants to get ready for high school and college careers and expose athletes to collegiate volleyball programs through recruiting efforts. We have no aspirations of growing into a sizable club with numerous teams in every age group. Limiting the number of Valor International teams allows us to focus on details while providing the highest quality club volleyball experience possible. Valor can assure that our extraordinary coaches are ready to instruct, guide, and support every player to grow with great opportunity and enjoyment of the game.</p>

                            <p> <a style="color:#FFDF00">•	RESPECT</a><br/> 
We want players to feel at home and enjoy playing Volleyball. Challenges will arise, but the most important thing we must remember this is a team, a family. Respecting one another is a must to ensure that we work better together and grow as leaders.<br/><br/> <a style="color:#FFDF00">•	DISCIPLINE</a><br/>
Every coach at Valor will teach and help you to improve your discipline. Discipline is improved by practicing and obeying rules and behavior tasks that will help develop the necessary characteristics to achieve success. At Valor, every player should understand that your best effort and discipline are required on and off the court.<br/><br/> <a style="color:#FFDF00">•	HUMILITY</a><br/>
Teaching humility in sports provides athletes with a powerful tool. Humble athletes earn respect from their teammates, coaches, and competitors. Most importantly, they can help create an environment where everyone treats the other with respect. In an environment like this, every athlete has the opportunity to thrive.<br/><br/> <a style="color:#FFDF00">•	INTEGRITY</a><br/> 
As we preserve everyone’s importance at Valor, we want to have quality and honesty when it comes to each other. Having strong moral principles helps a team be ready to confront all situations that could arise. Honesty and respect for each other will not only build strong chemistry between players, coaches, and parents. It will help us to understand and solve any challenges.<br/><br/> <a style="color:#FFDF00">•	DEDICATION</a><br/> 
We  want  our players to always reach for excellence. Improvement is just a matter of a strong work ethic with effort and commitment. We believe that success comes from unyielding dedication and love for what we do. We do not encourage our athletes to show up at practices or games just because they need to. Let’s have the best times and dedicate every second to becoming the best we can be.<br/><br/> <a style="color:#FFDF00">•	RESILIENCE</a><br/> 
Resilience is a strong word in the sports community. It defines what we want our athletes to obtain on and off the volleyball court. We don’t always win. Teaching that part of a sport can be a tough challenge for coaches. Resilience comes from the heart; you need to recover from any trying situations in your life. Our trained coaching staff dedicates themselves to helping our athletes overcome challenges and shape self-confidence and pride.</p>
